## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```


```{r c1, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("vegan")
```

This is the code that your going to load the ggplot2 package and plot a scatter plot of speed vs dist from the cars dataset

```{r c2,}
library(vegan)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Scatter plot of speed vs dist",
       x = "Speed",
       y = "Distance")
```

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
docker pull nextgenusfs/funannotate

conda create -n sequali-env python=3.1.0 -c conda-forge
conda activate sequali-env
conda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda sequali
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
